FP1. Match 3d objects

Algorithm:

iterate over the matches

	find the prev point  and curr point in the matches

	find the corresponding id of the bounding box in the previous frame and current frame
	
	if found store in a matrix where the rows represent previous frame ID and the columns current frame ID.
		For every ID found increase the  cell of the matrix by one each time.
 
	
iterate over each row
	
	find the biggest value in the row. The value of this cell is the best bounding box pair in the previous frame and current frame.






FP2. Compute Lidar TTC

Get all  the points in previous frame in the x direction.

Get all the points in current frame in the y direction.

Compute Median as it is more robust to big outliers than the mean.

Find the ttc  using:
	(current median x * (1/frame rate))/(previous median x - current median x)







FP3. Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes

For all matches that belong in the bounding box, store them in a vector.

Get the mean size of the distances in this vector and get a minimum threshold value.

If the matches are within this threshold put these points in Bounding Box KeyPoint Matches.





FP4. Computer Camera TTC


Find the points of the matches in the previous and current frame.

See if the distance between these are within the mean threshold.

And then compute the TTC using:
	TTC = -(1/frame rate)/(1 - mean dist ratios)





FP5. Evaluation

   Detectors:         SHITOMASI,FAST,HARRIS,ORB,AKAZE,SIFT
    Descriptors:    BRISK, BRIEF, ORB, FREAK, AKAZE, SIFT

Lidar and Camera TTC were calculated and the results are in the Results folder.

The default parameters for the matches were:

Matcher Type:           MAT_BF  
Descriptor Type:     DES_BINARY   except DES_HOG for SIFT
Selector Type:          SEL_NN


Though KNN and FLANN give more accurate matches, but there is always a trade off between accuracy and speed.
Which was already looked at the mid term project.

There were negative values for TTC and sometimes even NANs which were ignored.
Below is the list 

Detector	Descriptor	TTC lidar	TTC camera	TTC difference

SHITOMASI	ORB	          11.729	      12.34	             -0.615
SHITOMASI	SIFT	          11.729	      12.26	             -0.53
SHITOMASI	BRIEF	          11.729	      13.39	             -1.66
SHITOMASI	BRIEF	          11.729	      13.164	             -1.43


This shows that ShiTomasi and Akaze has values closest to the lidar TTC.
